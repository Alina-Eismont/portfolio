Dear web designer,

I am so delighted you have taken on our web design project. Many of my clients have been asking why we don't yet have an online presence. With a business to run and people to serve, who has time, darlings?

Well, we do. We cannot afford to ignore the web any longer. Many of my competitors around town have sites, and they're not just brochure sites, either! They have useful features like newsletters, online scheduling, slideshow tours, and all sorts of crazy stuff. But I know that (working with you) I can do a lot better.

You asked about my business goals for the site. I like a guy or gal who's up-front! The goal is, firstly, to promote my services by providing basic information on the spa's services: pricing, hours, contact information, and so on. You have no idea how many customers we might attract, provided the site is a relaxing, energizing, and luxurious experience, like my spa.

The second reason is to find ways to grow my business. A friend of mine tells me I could use my site to market to my customers, through email marketing, an online reservation system, and so on. I realize you may not be able to build some of those tools yourself (since we are just creating the shell of the site at the moment) but I would like to see some of those features incorporated into the visual design and planning (particularly if my crosstown competitors are offering something similar).

What I'd like to see is:

I. Some kind of visual guide to the strengths and weaknesses of my beloved competitors' sites.

II. A site map (no design yet) that shows me how you'd lay out my site.

III. A short overview of your thoughts on my project.

And that's it. Looking forward to working with you! Did I mention that complementary salon services are part of this business venture of ours?

Appreciatively,
Sapphira
